                    <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p>This is a simple web application built by two talented programmers, Jeffrey & Philip. We built this as a simple assignment for our eCommerce class. We received good feedback from our teacher. Then I decided to modify it and used it as a platform where other students/youth can leave a word of encouragement and be seen by others. We want to connect people and building a simple website like this is a small step to completing that vision.
